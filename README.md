# Popup Window with Success Message
This is a simple HTML webpage with a button that triggers a popup window to display a success message.

# Features:

A button labeled "submit".
A popup window that appears when the button is clicked.
The popup window displays a checkmark image, a success message ("Yay..!!!"), and a brief thank you message ("You submitted successfully. Thanks!").
A button within the popup window labeled "OK" that closes the popup when clicked.
# Implementation:

HTML is used to structure the webpage content and define the button and popup window elements.
CSS styles the visual appearance of the webpage elements, including the button, popup window, and its content.
JavaScript controls the popup window's behavior. It shows the popup when the button is clicked and hides it when the "OK" button inside the popup is clicked.
# How to Use:

Save the code as an HTML file (e.g., index.html).
Open the HTML file in a web browser.
Click the "submit" button to see the popup window appear.
Click the "OK" button inside the popup to close it.
